		<p>
			My name is Zuby! I'm a senior studying CS at SFSU. <br> 
			I'm the back-end lead for the software development project in my CSC 648 class. <br> 
			During my offtisme I play soccer and struggle through LeetCode problems. <br>
            I'm looking forward to learning about software development and building soft skills working in a team. <br>

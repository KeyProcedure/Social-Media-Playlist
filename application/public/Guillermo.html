    <p>
        My name is Guillermo this is my last semester at SFSU and my role for our team is Scrum Master. <br> 
        I like to spend time with family and friends on the weekends and play board games with my girlfriend. <br>
        I am hoping to learn a lot from this class pursue a software engineering role after graduating.

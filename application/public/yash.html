    <h1>Yash Bhadiyadra</h1>
    <p>
      Hey Everyone! I'm Yash Bhadiyadra, hailing from India as an international student. I 'm currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science. I'm usually calm and positive. My genuine interest lies in Artificial Intelligence, particularly Generative AI, and I'm also passionate about exploring the vast landscape of Cloud Computing. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new places, trying diverse cuisines with friends, and immersing myself in the world of cricket â€“ both watching and playing. Sci-fi movies are a favorite pastime, and I have a soft spot for anything related to cars.

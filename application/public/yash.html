    <p>
      Hey Everyone! I'm Yash Bhadiyadra, hailing from India as an international student. <br>
      I 'm currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science at SFSU. I'm usually calm and positive. <br>
      I'm a Supporter for the software development project in my CSC 848 class. <br>
      My genuine interest lies in Artificial Intelligence, particularly Generative AI, and I'm also passionate about exploring the vast landscape of Cloud Computing. <br>
      In my free time, I enjoy exploring new places, trying diverse cuisines with friends, and immersing myself in the world of cricket â€“ both watching and playing. <br>
      Sci-fi movies are a favorite pastime, and I have a soft spot for anything related to cars. <br>

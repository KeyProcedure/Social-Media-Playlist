      My name is Anthony and I am a student at San Francisco State University. I
      love to play soccer, and jiu-jitsu. <br />
      I'm an aspiring Software Engineer who's looking to further his knowledge
      in the field with a specialization in AI/ML. I'm looking forward to work
      with my team as Team Leader in order to deliver a great project at the end
      of the semester.

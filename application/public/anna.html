			Hello, my name is Anna and I'm a Computer Science major at SFSU and the Front-End Lead on this project. <br>
            I am a Bay Area native; born in San Francisco and raised in between the cities South San Francisco and Richmond. <br> 
			Some of my hobbies include playing video games, working on cars and riding my motorycle. <br>
			I also really enjoy being outdoors, specifically camping, backpacking or overlanding in my Jeep. <br>
			This past summer, I backpacked to the peak of Mount Whittenberg and camped there overnight.<br>
